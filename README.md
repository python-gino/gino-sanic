# gino-sanic

An extension for GINO to support Sanic server.

**This project "gino-sanic" is currently not maintained and needs adoption.** 

Since GINO 1.0, the built-in extensions are now separate projects supported by
the community. This project is copied here directly from GINO 0.8.x for
compatibility. Help is needed to:

* Keep this project maintained - follow Sanic releases, fix issues, etc.
* Add more examples and documentation.
* Answer questions in the community.
